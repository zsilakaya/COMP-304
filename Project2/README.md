COMP304 Project 2
Zeynep SÄ±la Kaya-69101


We have included a Makefile with our project. It can be used to compile the code with the command: make 

To run the program with desired arguments:
./main -n 4 -p 0.75 -q 5 -t 3 -b 0.05


We implemented all parts of the project.
Our program starts desired number of commentator threads, moderator thread  and the breaking event thread.
It asks as many questions as the input received and the program terminates when the last person who generates an answer to the question finish his/her speaking.

We also include 3 example log files with the command:
./main -n 4 -p 0.75 -q 5 -t 3 -b 0.05
